# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [Github](https://github.com/camigomez35/heroes-exercise).


## How to contribute

- If you're working on an **issue**, assign it to yourself or comment on this issue asking for it.

- First of all, fork this repo to yourself, create branches based on which kind of change are you going to work on. You can use "**feature**" or "**hotfix**" for example.

- As soon as you finished, you must run "**git add**", "**git commit -m '{your message here}'**" and "**git push --set-upstream origin feature/{your branch name}**".

- After pushing your code to Github, you can go to "**Pull Requests**" and create a PR for this repo.


## Pull Requests

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.


## Pull Request Template
